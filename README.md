# intro-clustering
The PowerPoint presentation I used to accompany my 15 minute talk about clustering methods at UT-Austin's Spring 2024 Directed Reading Program (DRP) Symposium. DRP pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to undertake independent projects in mathematics. My mentor was PhD student Addie Duncan.
